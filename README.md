## Overview

Data analysis is a powerful tool for informed decision-making, but it can be challenging for those without a technical background. This project aims to bridge that gap by creating an interactive web application that allows users to analyze data through natural language prompts. Streamlit provides the framework for the user interface, Pandas AI integrates OpenAI's GPT-3 for analysis, and interactive visualizations are brought to life using Plotly and Matplotlib.

## Technologies

- [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/): A Python library for creating interactive web applications with data visualization.
- [Pandas AI](https://pypi.org/project/pandasai/): A bridge between data analysis and natural language processing, using OpenAI's GPT-3.
- [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/): Leverages GPT-3's language understanding capabilities to process prompts and generate human-like analysis insights.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): A graphing library for creating interactive, publication-quality graphs and figures.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
